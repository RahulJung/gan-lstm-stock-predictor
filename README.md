# AI-Driven Stock Market Prediction with GAN + LSTM

## Overview

This project explores deep learning for financial forecasting by implementing a **baseline LSTM model** and an **enhanced GAN + LSTM hybrid** for stock price prediction.

**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**

LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. They are particularly effective for time series forecasting because they can remember past information over many time steps, making them well-suited for predicting stock prices based on historical patterns.

**GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)**

GANs consist of two competing neural networks ‚Äî a generator and a discriminator ‚Äî that learn through adversarial training. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. Over time, the generator produces increasingly realistic synthetic data.

**LSTM + GAN Hybrid**

In this project, the GAN is used to generate synthetic stock price sequences that mimic real market patterns. These synthetic sequences are combined with real historical data to train the LSTM model. This augmentation expands the dataset and introduces more variability, allowing the LSTM to generalize better and make more accurate predictions.

## Performance Improvement

**Baseline LSTM Model:** 
Achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.98, RMSE of 7.32, and R¬≤ of 0.64.

**GAN + LSTM Model:** 
After enriching the training set with 100k+ synthetic sequences from the GAN, the LSTM achieved MAE = 0.4961, MSE = 0.5497, and R¬≤ = 0.9980 ‚Äî a dramatic improvement in predictive accuracy.

By combining GANs and LSTMs, this approach benefits from LSTM‚Äôs ability to model sequential dependencies and GAN‚Äôs power to generate diverse, realistic training data, making it more robust for stock market prediction.

**Gen-AI Chatbot ‚Äî Stock Buddy**

Stock Buddy is an AI-powered trading assistant that leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to provide real-time, data-grounded market insights.

Built with LangChain for orchestration, it integrates Pinecone vector search to retrieve relevant market data, technical indicators, sentiment analysis, and GAN + LSTM model predictions. Retrieved context is passed to OpenAI GPT-4, which generates natural, explainable responses tailored to the user‚Äôs risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive).

**The chatbot can:**

Explain market conditions and technical signals.

Summarize model predictions with rationale.

Suggest buy/hold/sell actions.

Provide quick backtesting summaries.

This architecture ensures responses are both accurate and actionable, combining deep learning forecasts with conversational AI.

## Goals

**Accurate Stock Prediction** ‚Äì Forecast short-term and medium-term stock price movements using advanced deep learning models.

**Data Augmentation with GANs** ‚Äì Improve LSTM training by generating realistic synthetic stock sequences to enhance model generalization.

**Automated Technical Analysis** ‚Äì Calculate and interpret indicators like RSI, MACD, and moving averages without manual intervention.

**Personalized Trading Strategies** ‚Äì Adapt recommendations to user-defined risk profiles (conservative, moderate, aggressive).

**Conversational AI Insights** ‚Äì Integrate predictions into a RAG-powered chatbot for real-time, explainable, and data-grounded investment advice.
